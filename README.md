# 🚀 AM-Core Blockchain

Hi! I'm **Amir**! 👋 I'm a computer engineering student (second term, baby! 🎓). 
I love coding in C#, Python, AI, Java, and... okay, a *little* HTML. 🤫

This is my super cool Blockchain project! 
Big shoutout to my awesome friend and contributor **Moein Hosseini**! 🤝🔥

## 🛠️ What can this program do?

It's a CLI blockchain miner! Here are the options you can use to become a crypto tycoon (fake internet money only 😜):

- **`SetDifficulty(number)`** 🧱  
  Make mining harder or easier! (e.g., `SetDifficulty(5)`)

- **`AddTransactionToMempool(filepath)`** 💸  
  Load transactions from a file like a boss. (e.g., `AddTransactionToMempool(tx.json)`)

- **`EvictMempool(count)`** 🧹  
  Clean up the pool! Kick out old transactions. (e.g., `EvictMempool(10)`)

- **`MineBlock`** ⛏️💎  
  The fun part! Mine a block and secure the chain.

- **`Help`** 🆘  
  Use this if you get lost!

## 🏃 How to run
Just run the `ConsoleApp`, type a command, and watch the magic happen! ✨
